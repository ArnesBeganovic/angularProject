This code is used at link above. It shows angular + bootstrap in action. It is NOT fully developed website which means buttons, external links and 
popups are not working. It shows frame and compoenent composition, included in bootstrap functionality. THis means if you resize your screen,
the page will not lose its view and behavior. 

It is possible to click at main menu which will show different component. Dashboard and Orders components are developed with subcomponents.
